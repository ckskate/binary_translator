===THE BINARY TRANSLATOR===

I directly took the DOM walker function from Kyle Killion's xkcd-substitutions extension, who in turn took the function from Steven Frank's cloud-to-butt extension.

I'm very new to GitHub and coding in general, so I figured this would be a good starting point. There is no practical purpose to this,
however I enjoy installing it on computers at my school to mess with people. Enjoy!

===INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS===

The packed chrome extension is included in the files, you simply need to go to settings>extensions and drag the file onto the screen.
